# Basic Python projects
This repository is a collection of beginner Python programs, including:
- A `State` class and a set of functions to analyze recent election data (`state.py`, `election.py`)
- A `RoadMap` class that represents street/traffic data and computes travel times (`graph.py`)
- A Hangman game (`hangman.py`)
- A shortest path finder for weighted directed graphs (`pathoptimization.py`)
